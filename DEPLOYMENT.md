# Vercel Deployment Guide for Neon Vault Drops

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Neon Vault Drops application to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- Vercel account (free tier available)
- GitHub account with access to the repository
- Node.js installed locally (for testing)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare the Repository

Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Connect to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import the `patrick55schmidt/neon-vault-drops` repository

### 3. Configure Project Settings

#### Build Settings
- **Framework Preset**: Vite
- **Root Directory**: `./` (default)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

#### Environment Variables
Add the following environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/b18fb7e6ca7045ac83c41157ab93f990
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=2ec9743d0d0cd7fb94dee1a7e6d33475
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=b18fb7e6ca7045ac83c41157ab93f990
```

### 4. Deploy

1. Click "Deploy" button
2. Wait for the build process to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. Your application will be available at the provided Vercel URL

### 5. Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to Project Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as instructed by Vercel
4. Wait for SSL certificate to be issued

## Build Configuration

### vercel.json (Optional)
Create a `vercel.json` file in the root directory for advanced configuration:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID` | Ethereum chain ID (11155111 for Sepolia) | Yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` | RPC endpoint URL | Yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID` | WalletConnect project ID | Yes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY` | Infura API key | Yes |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**
   - Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Ensure TypeScript compilation passes locally
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

2. **Wallet Connection Issues**
   - Verify WalletConnect Project ID is correct
   - Check RPC URL is accessible
   - Ensure chain ID matches your target network

3. **Asset Loading Issues**
   - Check that all assets are in the `public` directory
   - Verify file paths in components are correct
   - Ensure favicon and other static assets are properly referenced

### Build Logs

Access build logs in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click on the deployment
3. View "Build Logs" tab for detailed error information

## Performance Optimization

### Recommended Settings

1. **Enable Edge Functions** (if using Vercel Pro)
2. **Configure CDN** for static assets
3. **Enable Compression** for better loading times
4. **Set up Analytics** to monitor performance

### Bundle Analysis

To analyze bundle size:
```bash
npm run build
npx vite-bundle-analyzer dist
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive keys to repository
2. **CORS**: Configure CORS settings for API calls
3. **HTTPS**: Vercel automatically provides SSL certificates
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for API calls

## Monitoring and Analytics

1. **Vercel Analytics**: Enable in project settings
2. **Error Tracking**: Consider integrating Sentry or similar
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Use Vercel's built-in performance insights

## Updates and Maintenance

### Automatic Deployments
- Vercel automatically deploys on every push to main branch
- Preview deployments are created for pull requests

### Manual Deployments
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from local directory
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Vercel documentation: [vercel.com/docs](https://vercel.com/docs)
2. Review build logs in Vercel dashboard
3. Test build locally: `npm run build && npm run preview`
